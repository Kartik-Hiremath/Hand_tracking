Hand tracking : Palm detection + Hand landmark

Note : 

# Step 1: Initialize the camera (index 0 is the default camera)
# Step 2: Capture a frame from the camera
# Step 3: If the frame is not read correctly, stop the program
# Step 4: Show the captured frame in a window named "Image"
# Step 5: Check if the user pressed the 'q' key to break the loop
# Step 6: Release the camera and close all OpenCV windows
